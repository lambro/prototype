        <h1>About Laura</h1><br>
        After graduating from my Masters, I decided to take some time out and travel Asia. I moved to Korea, where I taught English at first. While I was doing this I had a scooter accident, which made me realise that life is short and I should appreciate every day I have. I made an effort to get into jobs that I would wake up in the morning and look forward to going in to do, first at advertising agencies, then went on to do some modelling, TV work and play bass guitar in a band. I then decided to return to London and after a year back started experimenting with coding and ruby on the advice of many of my close friends, who described me as a "massive geek who just didn't know it yet". I realised it was something that I really enjoyed and that I wanted to do everyday so took steps to make this part of my life and work with my courses at General Assembly.

          "Coding all day every day!"
          After enjoying General Assembly's Front End course I wanted a more involved course that would help me switch careers. I really enjoyed learning how to build sites and apps from the back to the front. I am looking forward to applying what I have learnt to my daily life and work.
          <br>
          I learnt a variety of coding languages, with focus on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Some of the languages and frameworks covered include SQL, Sinatra, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Canvas, JQuery, Ajax, Angular.js, Node.js, CSS/SCSS, HTML/HAML and Git regularly. <br>
          We practiced an AGILE environment for our work, using Trello to organise group work.

            My first project on General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. This was my first real work with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. We had a week to complete it. <br>
            I used Github and Trello for version management and organisation. <br>

                We used Github and Trello for version management and organisation. <br>
                I designed all the Front End and we also divided the Back End together. <br>

                <h1>"Let's Play"</h1>
                This was my final project on General Assembly's three month Web Development Course. It was open topic. I chose to make a site to organise social gaming sessions with friends and other gamers. We had two weeks to complete it, and I had a really ambitious project with a large number of tables and interactions. This project was written in Ruby on Rails with Angular.js Front End, which we had only studied for a week, and a Rails Engine, which we had never used before at all. It was a great learning experience that is ongoing.
